STUDENT PROJECT REPORT

INTRODUCTION:
Water is the most quintessential element for the survival of mankind. It remains an important 
source of food, nutrition, income and livelihood for millions of people around the world Its variety of 
uses means that it is always in constant state of demand. In the state of Tamil Nadu, supply of 
water most primarily comes from large reservoirs of water such as lakes, streams, seas and the 
ocean itself. As such, it is good practice to monitor the quality of water to ensure it is fit for human 
consumption. The Current water quality monitoring is often carried out in traditional labs but is time 
consuming and prone to inaccuracies.

OBJECTIVES:
Our project aims to investigate the feasibility of implementing an Arduino-based sensor system for 
water quality monitoring. It focuses on the major parameters including pH of water, temperature, 
turbidity and TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) required for survival of aqua-culture. Rivers are 
complex life support systems that operate thin line of Sustainability. In the recent history of Tamil 
Nadu, the sharp increase in the human population has resulted in a considerable increase in the 
need for freshwater. A water flow driven network can be deployed to reduce the time needed to 
detect leakage or contamination in urban water distribution system, Water Service industry is 
heavily influenced by IoT and are able to share information through internet connections.
A model consisting of a micro controller and multiple attached sensors namely the pH sensor, 
Waterproof Temperature sensor (DS18B20), Turbidity sensor (Value Detection module) and Analog 
TDS sensor module kit was integrated to conduct the parameters testing on a weekly onsite basis 
at multiple day intervals. The system works reliably but is reliant on human assistance and is prone 
to data inaccuracies. The system however, provides solid foundation for future expansion works of 
the water monitoring category to elevate the system being IoT friendly.

METHODOLOGY
The development of simple prototype system fit for water quality monitoring to be comprised with the 
distinct components.
• The primary step would be calibrating and rounding off various decimal units with the respect
to the specific values determining the salinity, turbidity and temperature of the water body.
• The system used is an Arduino micro controller with four accommodating sensors, RELAND 
SUN pH sensor with a temperature range of -10 C to 50 C. It has a response time of under 
5s but a selling time to stabilize with the environment. DS18B20 Temperature sensor that 
has operating range that has operating range from - 55 C to +125 C with an accuracy of +/-
0.5 C. 
• The Turbidity and pH sensors require calibration to convert the obtained voltage readings to 
the corresponding turbidity and pH readings. To calibrate, to different concentration of soils 
and water mixtures and different pH solutions were used to calibrate the turbidity and pH 
sensors, respectively.
All the integrated sensors were integrated via capillary tube and mounted on a Water Buoy.

WORK PLAN
The Timeline of the project is dividing according to the component and work attributes. 
⚫ Primarily task was to finalize the plan of action with definite research papers and component 
selections. Important tasks here were understanding the work flow and design consideration 
required to carry out the project.
⚫ Then working on the Design and Analysis of the Sea Buoy under distinct static and dynamic 
analysis with various wave forms of air and water medium to create a mesh for fundamental 
balance of the system with integrated sensors. The Turbidity and pH sensors require 
calibration to convert the obtained voltage readings to the corresponding turbidity and pH 
readings..

IMPACT OF OUR PROJECT TOWARDS SOCIETY:
• In the State of Tamil Nadu, supply of water most primarily comes from large reservoirs of 
water such as lakes, streams, seas and the ocean itself. As such, the condition monitoring 
system can be a good interface to monitor and work with
promoting growth to the fisheries department.
• Overall idea about the percentage of cultivated water for sediment washing, primary usage ![WhatsApp Image 2023-05-17 at 4 26 45 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09c3578f-7cef-46ad-94d5-8c32d57af4e9)

of salt water to freshwater ratio and Urban runoff, fish aquaculture and other eco-systems 
could be monitored and promoted.
• With the respect to the parameters various methodologies could be implemented in 
development and improvement of fish and water culture.
ADVANTAGES AND APPLICATIONS:
• One of the vital advantages of using our project would help in continuous monitoring and 
development of various interdependary eco-systems among water culture.
• Thorough idea about type and application of water with its constituents and fishes could be 
monitored and be used according to its work usage.
• Overall, the water condition monitoring buoy can be used in various applications for the
development of the water work culture
